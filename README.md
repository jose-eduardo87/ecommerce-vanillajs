# E-COMMERCE APPLICATION

 ###### ************ THIS IS VERY MUCH A WIP!! ************


App developed using NodeJS, express, mongoDB, mongoose, vanilla JS and PUG to render the application on the server. I decided not to use React or any other frontend framework because I wanted to 
test my skills only with pure JS. I have also used JWT for authentication, bcrypt for passwords encryption, nodemailer, axios for AJAX requests, and a couple of security middlewares like xss-clean, hpp, 
express-mongo-sanitize, helmet, express-rate-limit. The error handling solution is robust and centralized, meaning the entire application can use it, making tracking errors and creating custom messages easier.


 ## FEATURES:

This application comes with filtering and sorting capabilities, where the user can filter and sort queried results by price, sex, color and so on. There is also a complete 
pagination logic implemented, most of which is processed on the backend. The features implemented thus far include but is not limited to the following:

* LOGIN
* AUTHENTICATION
* AUTHORIZATION
* SECURITY
* CREATION, READING, UPDATE AND DELETION OF ALL DOCUMENTS


### TO-DO:

* PAYMENT SYSTEM
* E-MAIL HANDLING (PASSWORD RECOVERY, WELCOME MESSAGE ETC)
* LOGOUT PAGE
* COUPON LOGIC
* FIX SOME FRONTEND ERRORS AND MISSING FEATURES (USER'S REVIEWS ON HOME PAGE, )
* IMAGES MANAGEMENT (SHARP AND MULTER WILL BE USED FOR THAT)
* SINGLE PAGE PRODUCT SMALL FIXES


PS: Frontend was not created by me. I found this template on the internet. 


Lastly, writing this application has been such a fun and fulfilling journey where I have learned a ton of new stuff every time I opened my IDE. This application is the 
first project I have done by myself without help from courses, tutorials etc. With all that said, the intent of this application is purely educational so I take no responsibility if you decide
to use it and anything unexpected happens.


If you have any questions, feedback about this code (I would love to have some!) or just want to have a good chat, you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Eduardod_Araujo) and my
